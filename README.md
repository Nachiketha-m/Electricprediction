# Electricprediction

##The following project was created during a hackathon held by PES University with the theme sustainability at the back of mind.

Download the dataset homec which is a zip file; unzip it and use the csv file.
This dataset consisted of energy consumption by minute of each appliance in the house.

The aim was to recognise a pattern on the users daily energy consumption and then suggest him on where he can cut down on it.

We have used Artificial neural network for the training and prediciton of the data.


Download the Untitled.ipynb file and run it on jupyter notebook; make sure HomeC.csv is in the same repository as the jupyter notebook.
